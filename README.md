# Audio file to voice message Telegram Bot 
The bot has been tested successfully with .mp3 & .ogg files.
Add your bot token to the environment variable `TELOXIDE_TOKEN`.
> [!WARNING]  
> Bot is made with simplicity in mind, therefore it lacks support for voice message duration, voice graph, "typing" indicator to tell user that it is working on the request. As there is no "typing" indicator, you have to wait some time while bot is making its magic.
